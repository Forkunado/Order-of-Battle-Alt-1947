An Alternate History Scenario in pre-Alpha

Background:

1944:

After the success of the Valkyrie plot resulting in the death of Hitler, and Kruschev's orchestration of Stalin's assassination, the world has been in an uneasy state of ceasefire.

The failure of the US to kill Yamamoto has led him to become an even greater national hero. The discovery of the US plot draws the ire of the World's opinion. Yamamoto now has the ear of the Emperor, leading to Tojo's downfall. The more moderate Suzuki is promoted from Chamberlain to Prime Minister, leading to a complete change in Japanese Strategy focusing on protecting and improving supply lines and an end to expansion and aggression. Suzuki travels to the US and sues for peace, which the US grudgingly accepts.

While Japan has hopes of the consolidation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the US is unhappy with the current situation and the lack of opportunities in Asian markets during the cease fire. US industrialists and certain 'paid-for' politicians, flush with capital but concerned about the collapsing US economy go behind Truman's back and begin funding a campaign of financial and infrastructure sabotage across Asia to provoke Japan into action.

After over two years of an unsteady peace with all sides licking their wounds and trying to recover, the world waits for the inevitable resumption of hostilities.

June 1946:

The 'big one' hits the West Coast. A magnitude 7 earth quake rocks the west coast, devastating San Francisco, Los Angeles and causing serious damage as far north as Seattle. In San Francisco, The Golden Gate bridge and Bay Bridge fall into the bay, and major portions of the city are leveled. The US economy, already suffering from the burden of the aborted war, is dealt a harsh blow.

May 1947:

The reconstruction of San Francisco is well underway, but the city is a shell of its former self. In Asia, Japan continues to suffer under the effects of the sabotage campaign backed by renegade US and European industrialists even as trials begin in the US and England and some conspirators are indicted. While Suzuki and Yamamoto recommend peaceful negotations, and Truman attempts to repair the damage, the younger cadre of recently blooded officers in the Imperial Army and Navy push Hirohito to act. Japan decides to strike again and take put an end to the thorn in their side by moving the fight from Asia to North America in a series of limited but decisive attacks to further set back US production.

Japan's first counterstrike: San Francisco

Your mission is to repel the Japanese invasion with the forces at hand.

TODO: A whole lot of stuff, specifically creating objectives and victory/defeat conditions. I am hoping for github contributors to help me make this scenario playable.  The forces are pretty well balanced, but the AI needs a lot of work. The scenario should be pretty easily winnable by your US forces if you are careful and don't get too aggressive. Try to play without having to purchase additional units, although I've loaded this Alpha up with points if you need them. This is very much an Alpha scenario.  Alt 1947 means getting to play with all of the fun 1945 toys.

The map is made from a 1947 USGS survey map, adjusted to work with the constraints of the game.
